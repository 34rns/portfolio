🚀 Welcome to My Portfolio!
Hey there, internet explorer! 👋
You’ve just stumbled into the digital sandbox of RAIYAN NOOR SIAM (RNS) — developer, designer, and occasional bug whisperer. (a little bit of cybersecurity, photoshop)

This repo holds the code behind my personal portfolio site — the place where I collect my favorite projects, experiments, and caffeine‑powered breakthroughs.

🧩 What’s Inside
Slick design: Because aesthetics matter as much as algorithms.
Responsive layout: Works perfectly on everything from a widescreen to a toaster (in theory).
Projects section: A curated gallery of code I’m proud of — complete with demo links and pretty pictures.
Contact area: For professional opportunities, friendly hellos, or spontaneous memes.
💡 Tech Stuff
Built with:

HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (maybe React or your favorite framework — you decide)
Deployed via GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel
Version controlled like a responsible adult


🧠 About Me
“Good code is like a good joke: it needs no explanation.”

I love building things that make people smile — apps that are intuitive, useful, and maybe even a bit whimsical.
If I’m not coding, I’m probably doodling UI ideas, sipping coffee, or debugging my weekend plans.
